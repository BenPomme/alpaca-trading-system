**🧠 LEARNING ALGORITHMS:**
```python
# Strategy Performance Scoring
performance_score = (win_rate * 0.4) + (avg_return * 0.3) + (sharpe_ratio * 0.3)

# Auto-parameter Adjustment
if performance_score > 0.8:
    increase_position_size *= 1.1
elif performance_score < 0.4:
    decrease_position_size *= 0.9
```

- **Breakout Strategy (20% allocation):** For low volatility environments (VIX <15)
- **Earnings Strategy (10% allocation):** 3-day windows around earnings

**📊 DYNAMIC ALLOCATION:**
```python
# Market Regime-Based Allocation
if market_regime == 'bull':
    momentum_allocation = 0.5
    mean_reversion_allocation = 0.2
elif market_regime == 'sideways':
    momentum_allocation = 0.2
    mean_reversion_allocation = 0.5
```
